## AI Notice

This project was developed with partial assistance from **Gemini 3 Pro** via Google AI Studio.

While AI was used as a supporting tool, a substantial portion of the codebase was written and designed manually. In several cases, AI-generated output required correction or replacement due to bugs or suboptimal implementations. Ensuring code quality and correctness remained a manual responsibility throughout the project.

Estimated contribution breakdown:
- ~35% AI-generated code  
- ~15% AI-assisted revisions  
- ~50% fully manual implementation  

Transparency regarding the use of AI tools is important to me, and all architectural decisions, final implementations, and validations were made by myself.

## ✨ Features

### 🎵 Native .osz Import
Drag-and-drop your favorite beatmaps directly into the engine. The engine automatically extracts and processes audio files, backgrounds, and hit objects in real-time.

### ⚙️ Precise Engine Logic
- **Accurate Calculations**: Approach Rate (AR) and Circle Size (CS) computed according to official Osu! specifications
- **Correct Slider Physics**: Full velocity multiplier support and timing point synchronization
- **Hit Detection**: Frame-perfect hit registration with proper margin calculations

### 🔊 Web Audio API Integration
Minimal latency through direct `AudioContext` usage ensures perfect synchronization between audio and visual elements.

### 🎨 Modern UI/UX
- Responsive interface design with dynamic backgrounds
- Smooth blur effects and fluid transitions
- Built with Tailwind CSS for consistent styling

### 📊 Complete Scoring System
- Full accuracy calculation (300s, 100s, 50s, Misses)
- Combo tracking and multipliers
- Comprehensive result screen with statistics

### Key Files Explained

- **App.tsx**: Main React component managing game state and UI
- **index.tsx**: Entry point that mounts React app to the DOM
- **constants.ts**: Game constants (hit windows, AR/CS formulas, etc.)
- **types.ts**: TypeScript interfaces for Beatmap, HitObject, GameState, etc.
- **GameCanvas.tsx**: React component rendering the game field using Canvas API
- **beatmapParser.ts**: Utility to parse `.osu` file format and extract metadata
- **gameLogic.ts**: Core engine containing timing calculations and hit detection

---

## 🎮 How It Works

### Beatmap Loading
1. User uploads or drag-drops a `.osz` file
2. JSZip extracts the compressed archive
3. The engine parses the `.osu` metadata file using `beatmapParser.ts`
4. Audio and background assets are loaded asynchronously

### Gameplay Loop
1. **Audio Sync**: Web Audio API provides frame-accurate timing via `AudioContext.currentTime`
2. **Hit Detection**: GameCanvas renders circles and evaluates clicks against `gameLogic.ts`
3. **Scoring**: Accuracy is calculated in real-time and displayed
4. **Result Screen**: Final statistics are shown after completion

### Timing Accuracy
- Uses `AudioContext.currentTime` for precise audio synchronization
- Frame-perfect hit registration with configurable hit windows (defined in `constants.ts`)
- Automatic correction for system latency

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Game behavior is centralized in `constants.ts` and `types.ts`. TypeScript ensures type safety:

```typescript
// constants.ts - Hit windows configuration
export const HIT_WINDOWS = {
  perfect: 50,    // ±50ms for 300
  good: 100,      // ±100ms for 100
  ok: 150         // ±150ms for 50
};

// Approach Rate formula
export const calculateApproachRate = (ar: number): number => {
  // Official Osu! AR calculation
};
```

Adjust these values in `constants.ts` to customize gameplay difficulty and timing windows.

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- **Slider Ticks**: Slider tick scoring is currently simplified
- **Spinners**: Spinner mechanics require additional work
- **Sound Effects**: Hitsounds are not yet implemented
- **Multiplayer**: This is a single-player experience
